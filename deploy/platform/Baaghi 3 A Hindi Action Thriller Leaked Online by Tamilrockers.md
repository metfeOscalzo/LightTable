However, the film's box office performance was affected by the illegal online leak by Tamilrockers, a notorious website that uploads pirated copies of movies and shows. According to reports[^1^] [^2^], Baaghi 3 was available for free HD downloading on Tamilrockers within hours of its release. This caused a huge loss for the makers and distributors of the film, who had invested a lot of money and effort in its production and promotion.
 
Tamilrockers is not the only website that leaks movies online. There are many other sites that offer torrent downloads of Baaghi 3 and other Bollywood films, such as bustamante alessanet[^1^]. These sites are illegal and unethical, as they violate the copyright laws and deprive the creators and artists of their rightful earnings. Moreover, downloading movies from these sites can expose users to malware and viruses that can harm their devices and data.
 
Therefore, it is advised to avoid using these sites and watch movies legally on official platforms or in theatres. Baaghi 3 is an entertaining film that deserves to be watched on the big screen with proper sound and visuals. By supporting legal and ethical ways of watching movies, we can also support the film industry and encourage more quality content in the future.

Baaghi 3 received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, who praised the action sequences and Tiger Shroff's performance, but criticized the weak script, illogical plot and excessive violence. The film has a rating of 2.1 out of 10 on IMDb[^1^], 0% on Rotten Tomatoes[^2^] and 2.5 out of 5 on The Times of India[^3^]. Some critics also compared the film unfavorably to its original Tamil version, Vettai, and found it lacking in originality and humor.
 
Despite the negative reviews, Baaghi 3 was a commercial success at the box office, earning over â¹135 crore worldwide. The film was also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the closure of theatres in many countries. The film was later released on Disney+ Hotstar, where it became one of the most watched titles on the platform. Baaghi 3 is the third installment in the Baaghi franchise, which started with Baaghi (2016) and Baaghi 2 (2018). The makers have announced a fourth film, Baaghi 4, which is expected to release in 2022.

Baaghi 3 also features some catchy songs and dance numbers that add to the entertainment quotient of the film. The film has four songs composed by different music directors and sung by various artists. The songs are:
 
- "Dus Bahane 2.0" - a remake of the 2005 hit song "Dus Bahane" from the film Dus, composed by Vishal-Shekhar and sung by Vishal Dadlani, Shekhar Ravjiani and KK[^1^].
- "Bhankas" - a remake of the 1984 song "Ek Aankh Maru To" from the film Tohfa, composed by Tanishk Bagchi and sung by Bappi Lahiri, Dev Negi and Jonita Gandhi[^2^].
- "Do You Love Me" - a dance number featuring Disha Patani, composed by Tanishk Bagchi and sung by Nikhita Gandhi. The song is based on the original music by RenÃ© Bendali[^3^].
- "Faaslon Mein" - a sad song that depicts the bond between the brothers, composed by Sachet-Parampara and sung by Sachet Tandon.

The songs of Baaghi 3 have received a positive response from the listeners and have crossed millions of views on YouTube. The songs are also choreographed by well-known choreographers like Ganesh Acharya, Adil Shaikh and Prince Gupta.
